This repository contains a SQL script developed by Ankita Chougule for creating a database and several tables to store information related to a school.

1. **CourseMaster Table**:
   - Stores information about different courses offered by the school, including course ID, name, category, and fee.

2. **StudentMaster Table**:
   - Contains details of students enrolled in the school, such as student ID, name, origin, and type.

3. **EnrollmentMaster Table**:
   - Represents the enrollment records of students in various courses, capturing details like course ID, student ID, date of enrollment, fee waiver flag, and grade.

### Instructions:
- Run the script in a SQL Server environment to create the "school" database and the associated tables.
- The script also includes sample data insertion statements to populate the tables for testing and demonstration purposes.
- Additionally, the script provides various SQL queries for performing data analysis and retrieving specific information from the database.
